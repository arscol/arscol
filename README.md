## Hello! 😎

I'm **Carlos**, a developer based in Seville, Spain.

Historically more oriented to the Back End side, but overall, I enjoy building clean and performant software. I've been around coding stuff since **2010** always trying to do hard things the easy way, with good practices.

Comfortable developing projects in **team** environments with a focus on analytical thinking, verbal communication and mentoring.

I don't do social media.

Reachable by email: **im[at]arscol.dev**.
